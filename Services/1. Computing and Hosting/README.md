# Computing and hosting services

Google Cloud gives you options for computing and hosting. You can choose to do the following:

+ Work in a serverless environment.
+ Use a managed application platform.
+ Leverage container technologies to gain lots of flexibility.
+ Build your own cloud-based infrastructure to have the most control and flexibility.
+ You can imagine a spectrum where, at one end, you have most of the responsibilities for resource management and, at the other end, Google has most of those responsibilities.
