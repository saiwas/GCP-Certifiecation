# Virtual Machines / Compute Engine

A good choice for use cases that include the following:

+ Use virtual machines (VMs), called instances, to build your application, much like you would if you had your own hardware infrastructure. You can choose from a variety of instance types to customize your configuration to meet your needs and your budget.

+ Choose which global regions and zones to deploy your resources in, giving you control over where your data is stored and used.

+ Choose which operating systems, development stacks, languages, frameworks, services, and other software technologies you prefer.

+ Create instances from public or private images.

+ Use Google Cloud storage technologies or any third-party technologies you prefer.

+ Use Google Cloud Marketplace to quickly deploy pre-configured software packages. For example, you can deploy a LAMP or MEAN stack with just a few clicks.

+ Create instance groups to more easily manage multiple instances together.

+ Use autoscaling with an instance group to automatically add and remove capacity.

+ Attach and detach disks as needed.

+ Use SSH to connect directly to your instances.
