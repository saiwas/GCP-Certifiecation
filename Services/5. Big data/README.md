# Big data 

## Data analysis

**BigQuery :**
+ Create custom schemas that organize your data into datasets and tables.
+ Load data from a variety of sources, including streaming data.
+ Use SQL-like commands to query massive datasets very quickly. BigQuery is designed and optimized for speed.
+ Use the web UI, command-line interface, or API.
+ Load, query, export, and copy data by using jobs.
+ Manage data and protect it by using permissions.

## Batch and streaming data processing

**Dataflow :**
+ Provides a managed service and set of SDKs that you can use to perform batch and streaming data processing tasks
+ Works well for high-volume computation, especially when the processing tasks can clearly and easily be divided into parallel workloads
+ Great for extract-transform-load (ETL) tasks, which are useful for moving data between different storage media, transforming data into a more desirable format, or loading data onto a new storage system.

## Asynchronous messaging
+ Pub/Sub
