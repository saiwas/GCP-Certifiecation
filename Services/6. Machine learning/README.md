# Machine learning services

AI Platform offers a variety of powerful machine learning (ML) services. You can choose to use APIs that provide pre-trained models optimized for specific applications, or build and train your own large-scale, sophisticated models using a managed TensorFlow framework.

## Machine learning APIs
+ **Video Intelligence API** lets you use video analysis technology that provides label detection, explicit content detection, shot-change detection, and regionalization features.

+ **Speech-to-Text** lets you convert audio to text, recognizing over 110 languages and variants, to support your global user base. You can transcribe the text of users dictating to an applicationâ€™s microphone, enable command-and-control through voice, or transcribe audio files, among other use cases.

+ **Cloud Vision** lets you easily integrate vision detection features, including image labeling, face and landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and tagging of explicit content.

+ **Cloud Natural Language API** lets you add sentiment analysis, entity analysis, entity-sentiment analysis, content classification, and syntax analysis.

+ **Cloud Translation** lets you quickly translate source text into any of over a hundred supported languages. Language detection helps out in cases where the source language is not known.

+ **Dialogflow** lets you build conversational interfaces for websites, mobile applications, popular messaging platforms, and IoT devices. You can use it to build interfaces, such as chatbots, that are capable of natural and rich interactions with humans.

## AI Platform
AI Platform combines the managed infrastructure of Google Cloud with the power and flexibility of TensorFlow. You can use it to train your machine learning models at scale, and to host trained models to make predictions about new data in the cloud.

AI Platform enables you to train machine learning models by running TensorFlow training applications on Google Cloud, and hosts those trained models for you, so you can use them to get predictions about new data. AI Platform manages the computing resources that your training job needs to run, so you can focus more on your model than on hardware configuration or resource management.
