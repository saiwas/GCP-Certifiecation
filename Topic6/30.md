Introductory Info

**Company Overview -**
TerramEarth manufactures heavy equipment for the mining and agricultural industries. About 80% of their business is from mining and 20% from agriculture. They currently have over 500 dealers and service centers in 100 countries. Their mission is to build products that make their customers more productive.

**Solution Concept -**
There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with new computing modules.
Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of 120 fields of data per second, with
22 hours of operation per day, TerramEarth collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles.

**Existing Technical Environment -**
TerramEarth's existing architecture is composed of Linux and Windows-based systems that reside in a single U.S. west coast based data center. These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via FTP, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old.
With this data, TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60%. However, because the data is stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they wait for replacement parts.

**Business Requirements -**
Decrease unplanned vehicle downtime to less than 1 week.
Support the dealer network with more data on how their customers use their equipment to better position new products and services
Have the ability to partner with different companies "" especially with seed and fertilizer suppliers in the fast-growing agricultural business "" to create compelling joint offerings for their customers.

**Technical Requirements -**
Expand beyond a single datacenter to decrease latency to the American Midwest and east coast.
Create a backup strategy.
Increase security of data transfer from equipment to the datacenter.
Improve data in the data warehouse.
Use customer and equipment data to anticipate customer needs.

**Application 1: Data ingest -**
A custom Python application reads uploaded datafiles from a single server, writes to the data warehouse.
Compute:
Windows Server 2008 R2
- 16 CPUs
- 128 GB of RAM
- 10 TB local HDD storage

**Application 2: Reporting -**
An off the shelf application that business analysts use to run a daily report to see what equipment needs repair. Only 2 analysts of a team of 10 (5 west coast, 5 east coast) can connect to the reporting application at a time.
Compute:
Off the shelf application. License tied to number of physical CPUs
- Windows Server 2008 R2
- 16 CPUs
- 32 GB of RAM
- 500 GB HDD
Data warehouse:
A single PostgreSQL server
- RedHat Linux
- 64 CPUs
- 128 GB of RAM
- 4x 6TB HDD in RAID 0

**Executive Statement -**
Our competitive advantage has always been in our manufacturing process, with our ability to build better vehicles for lower cost than our competitors. However, new products with different approaches are constantly being developed, and I'm concerned that we lack the skills to undergo the next wave of transformations in our industry. My goals are to build our skills while addressing immediate market needs through incremental innovations.
Question
For this question, refer to the TerramEarth case study. To be compliant with European GDPR regulation, TerramEarth is required to delete data generated from its
European customers after a period of 36 months when it contains personal data. In the new architecture, this data will be stored in both Cloud Storage and
BigQuery. What should you do?

    A. Create a BigQuery table for the European data, and set the table retention period to 36 months. For Cloud Storage, use gsutil to enable lifecycle management using a DELETE action with an Age condition of 36 months.

    B. Create a BigQuery table for the European data, and set the table retention period to 36 months. For Cloud Storage, use gsutil to create a SetStorageClass to NONE action when with an Age condition of 36 months.

    C. Create a BigQuery time-partitioned table for the European data, and set the partition expiration period to 36 months. For Cloud Storage, use gsutil to enable lifecycle management using a DELETE action with an Age condition of 36 months.

    D. Create a BigQuery time-partitioned table for the European data, and set the partition period to 36 months. For Cloud Storage, use gsutil to create a SetStorageClass to NONE action with an Age condition of 36 months.

Question
For this question, refer to the TerramEarth case study. A new architecture that writes all incoming data to BigQuery has been introduced. You notice that the data is dirty, and want to ensure data quality on an automated daily basis while managing cost.
What should you do?

    A. Set up a streaming Cloud Dataflow job, receiving data by the ingestion process. Clean the data in a Cloud Dataflow pipeline.

    B. Create a Cloud Function that reads data from BigQuery and cleans it. Trigger it. Trigger the Cloud Function from a Compute Engine instance.

    C. Create a SQL statement on the data in BigQuery, and save it as a view. Run the view daily, and save the result to a new table.

    D. Use Cloud Dataprep and configure the BigQuery tables as the source. Schedule a daily job to clean the data.

Question
For this question, refer to the TerramEarth case study. Considering the technical requirements, how should you reduce the unplanned vehicle downtime in GCP?

    A. Use BigQuery as the data warehouse. Connect all vehicles to the network and stream data into BigQuery using Cloud Pub/Sub and Cloud Dataflow. Use Google Data Studio for analysis and reporting.

    B. Use BigQuery as the data warehouse. Connect all vehicles to the network and upload gzip files to a Multi-Regional Cloud Storage bucket using gcloud. Use Google Data Studio for analysis and reporting.

    C. Use Cloud Dataproc Hive as the data warehouse. Upload gzip files to a MultiRegional Cloud Storage bucket. Upload this data into BigQuery using gcloud. Use Google data Studio for analysis and reporting.

    D. Use Cloud Dataproc Hive as the data warehouse. Directly stream data into prtitioned Hive tables. Use Pig scripts to analyze data.
